                <h2><u>Intro</u></h2>
<p>So, I need to be vaguer about this write-up, but I wanted to put out something regarding a recent competition I did. It was a lot of fun. How I did was significantly better than it had been. I went from getting 717th place to 244th place. So that means I met my goal this year!! Anyway, I'm going to do a quick write-up of one of their sections.</p>
<p>This section was under their &quot;Enumeration and Exploitation&quot; category. It was the medium challenge and was indeed quite the challenge. I want to write about this one because I had to write some Python scripts for it, which I found to be a lot of fun.</p>
<h2><u>Methodology</u></h2>
<p>This one involved a .dll file that we had to find the flag within. The whole point was to try to &quot;unlock&quot; the program. Figure out how to view the code and get into the thing. This was a whole process not only to do but to figure out <em>how</em> to do it.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>My first thought was to try to run it, but I was worried about running a .dll on my device, for obvious reasons (still tried to though... do not recommend it... nothing happened it's just a stupid idea). So, after going to other problems for a while, I came back to this one. After looking up &quot;how to open .dll&quot; and things like that, I eventually figured out that you needed to use a decompiler to look at the .dll code. So, I started looking up decompilers and eventually found a couple of opens. The main one I used was a JetBrains based decompiler called <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a>.</p>
<h3>Taking Action</h3>
<p>Once I got all that up and running, I opened the .dll in the decompiler and started digging around. This is what I saw:</p>
<p><img src="decompiler.png" alt=".dll in DotPeek decompiler"></p>
<p>I then clicked the dropdown next to the crosslock app and one function <em>immediately</em> stuck out to me.</p>
<p><img src="securelock.png" alt="Securelock function"></p>
<p>So, I opened it up, and, lo and behold, there was everything, although not exactly in the format I wanted. Firstly, this was an AES encrypted key, so I was provided with a key and an IV. On top of that, I was given the encrypted flag, however, it was... well... encrypted. So I had to do a little messing around...</p>
<h3>The Scripts</h3>
<p>First, the key, IV, and secret were given in bytes. So I had to figure out how to get bytes into human-readable text. I found this solution to that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt;bytes = [&lt;key&gt;] 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;.join(map(chr, bytes))
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs the key for me. It was pretty easy to notice without converting the IV, but the key and IV were the same. I could tell due to the bytes being the same. So I didn't bother to go through the whole process with both. Once I had that, I needed to figure out how to get the encrypted flag.</p>
<p>I stumbled around a while trying to figure out how to best output this stuff as putting it into the same script I had for the key just output a garbled mess. So, I made a guess and tried to make a script that outputs hex for me. This is what I came up with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt;bytes = [&lt;secret&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt;''.join(format(x, '02x') for x in bytes)
</code></pre>
<h3>Finding The Flag</h3>
<p>This gave me the flag in hex. The reason it was so garbled was that it was encrypted with AES, so I took the hex, went into <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=AES_Decrypt(%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,'CBC','Hex','Raw',%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D)">Cyberchef</a> and put in the AES Decrypt option (which that link should've led you to). From there, I put the hex in, input the key and IV, changed the format of the key and IV to UTF8, and baked! And that's how I got the flag.</p>
