            Adding a sidebar here. I don't think this is going to be what it stays as, but for now this will be my braindump spot. The updates section will be just little bits when I actually change something on the site. Maybe change it over to taking github pushes? I'll have to figure that out.
            <br><br>
            Today I did a lot. I switched over to atabook for my guestbook stuff. I also changed my chatbox to be dark like the rest of my theme. I was thinking it, but someone pointed it out so I figured I'd just go ahead and do it.
            <br><br>
            I also want to add more buttons and blinkies. There's just a hundred bajillion things I want to do. Plus I have school work I've put off all week that I probably could've had done by now ;-;
            <br><br>
            It's pretty late right now and I got literally nothing done today other than this :) I'm going to try to turn my brain off. Signing off ~

    <p>Well that's a good question...</p>
    <p>MY GO-TO INTRO: <br>
        Hi! My name is < kat\kdove\whatever >, and I'm currently a student studying for a B.S. in Cybersecurity!</p>
    <p>But that's kinda cheesy... and not really who I want to be here. I want to be myself. That's why I've made this place.</p>
    <p>I've always had the want to build a website like this. Something I understood, something that was completely mine... and really felt like mine.</p>
    <p>And it feels like I finally have! This place I built from the ground up. It's all mine, hand sewn bit by bit, or patchworked more like it, but mine all the same.<br>
        I mean, that's the nature of these places. We build bits and pieces of ourselves from each other's creations. And I feel whole now that this longing to build
        this thing is finally satiated. But now the problem is it's all I want to work on ;-;</p>
    <p>
        Anyway, enough being cheesy. I would love it if you would write in my <a href="https://kdove.nekoweb.org/pages/guestbook/">guestbook</a> and tell me about yourself!
        Tell me why you're here and what brought you to love indie websites such as these. Thank you for taking the time to read this :)
        <br>
        <br>
        (P.S. please share buttons and blinkies with me I beg of you I want to collect so many ;-;)
