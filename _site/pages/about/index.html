                So I finally got back to working on this. I took a break and got done what I needed to. Now I can sorta just focus on this for a little bit.
                <br><br>
                Well, not really as much as I'd like. There are still other things I need to focus on. But my god have I been out of it. I don't even know what's going on.
                <br><br>
                I mean, I think I have an idea. I was having issues with my adhd medication. It stopped working and was just making be feel numb and dead all the time. It was doing more damage than helping in any way.
                <br><br>
                I tried talking with my doctor, but idk. I might make a full blog post ranting about all this. I also removed the old blog section cause I want to keep my old blog posts or more professional guide blog posts on my other website and just add new ones here.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I think imma make a more full blog post talking about everything going on and how I've been feeling, cause it's kinda been a pain. Signing off ~

            <p>
                Good news, I got almost everything for the end of this term done! I was able to focus for a little bit. But it feels like the days just disappear lately. I really want to start waking up sooner.
                <br><br>
                Also, if anyone has any suggestions for ways I can embed like a mini blog feed or something, or what to use, that would be awesome. I'm signing up for status.cafe for the statuses bar since I like it more than the imoods thing. And I can be more detailed.
                <br><br>
                But I want a mini blog for this sidebar section of the website. I heard of smol.pub, but I'm not sure if that's really for what I want. Cause I want to make tiny little statuses like these where I talk to myself, so it wouldn't really be whole entire blog posts. Just little blurbs? idk lol.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, I just found Spacehey and have been having a lot of fun with it. I treid to theme it after my website a bit. But there's a lot of people on there with a lot of stuff going on so it's a bit overwhelming idk. I will see how I like it.

                I told myself I wouldn't hyperfixate on this today and I'd get work done, but here we are lol.
                <br><br>
                I mean I'm not entirely surprised. I've never had the best control over it. It feels more like obsession rather than hyperfixation, but I guess that's how it can feel when it gets to be a lot. 
                <br><br>
                I just really love making this thing. It's the first time I've made a website I felt this proud of. I've always dreamed of doing web development and actually being able to make something like this, but I had kinda given up on being able to do that at some point.
                <br><br>
                There's still a lot I need to do, but I really do have to do at least some sort of work today. I really hope I can get myself to focus on what I need to do. Signing off ~

                Adding a sidebar here. I don't think this is going to be what it stays as, but for now this will be my braindump spot. The updates section will be just little bits when I actually change something on the site. Maybe change it over to taking github pushes? I'll have to figure that out.
                <br><br>
                Today I did a lot. I switched over to atabook for my guestbook stuff. I also changed my chatbox to be dark like the rest of my theme. I was thinking it, but someone pointed it out so I figured I'd just go ahead and do it.
                <br><br>
                I also want to add more buttons and blinkies. There's just a hundred bajillion things I want to do. Plus I have school work I've put off all week that I probably could've had done by now ;-;
                <br><br>
                It's pretty late right now and I got literally nothing done today other than this :) I'm going to try to turn my brain off. Signing off ~

    <h1 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Who is?</h1>
    <p>Well that's a good question...</p>
    <p>MY GO-TO INTRO: <br>
        Hi! My name is < kat\kdove\whatever >, and I'm currently a student studying for a B.S. in Cybersecurity!</p>
    <p>But that's kinda cheesy... and not really who I want to be here. I want to be myself. That's why I've made this place.</p>
    <p>I've always had the want to build a website like this. Something I understood, something that was completely mine... and really felt like mine.</p>
    <p>And it feels like I finally have! This place I built from the ground up. It's all mine, hand sewn bit by bit, or patchworked more like it, but mine all the same.<br>
        I mean, that's the nature of these places. We build bits and pieces of ourselves from each other's creations. And I feel whole now that this longing to build
        this thing is finally satiated. But now the problem is it's all I want to work on ;-;</p>
    <p>
        Anyway, enough being cheesy. I would love it if you would write in my <a href="https://kdove.nekoweb.org/pages/guestbook/">guestbook</a> and tell me about yourself!
        Tell me why you're here and what brought you to love indie websites such as these. Thank you for taking the time to read this :)
        <br>
        <br>
        (P.S. please share buttons and blinkies with me I beg of you I want to collect so many ;-;)
